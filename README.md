# Gooey
Gooey is a GUI system for the [Defold](https://www.defold.com) game engine. It is inspired by the excellent [Dirty Larry](https://github.com/andsve/dirtylarry) library.


# Installation
You can use Gooey in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

https://github.com/britzl/gooey/archive/master.zip

Or point to the ZIP file of a [specific release](https://github.com/britzl/gooey/releases).


# Usage
The Gooey system is encapsulated in a single Lua module without any visual components. It makes very little assumptions of the look and feel of the UI components it supports. Instead Gooey focuses on providing stable input and state handling and lets the user decide which states matter and how they should be presented visually.


## Input bindings
For Gooey to work it requires a couple of input bindings:

* Mouse trigger - ```mouse-button-1``` -> ```touch```
* Mouse trigger - ```mouse-wheel-up``` -> ```scroll_up``` (for scrolling in lists)
* Mouse trigger - ```mouse-wheel-down``` -> ```scroll_down``` (for scrolling in lists)
* Key trigger - ```key-backspace``` -> ```backspace``` (for text input)
* Text trigger - ```text``` -> ```text``` (for text input)
* Text trigger - ```marked-text``` -> ```marked_text``` (for text input)

![](docs/key_mouse_bindings.png)
![](docs/text_bindings.png)

The input binding constants listed above are defined in `gooey/actions.lua` and can be changed.

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON ANDROID**: Make sure that the Input Method in the Android section of the game.project file is set to HiddenInputField. This will ensure that virtual keyboard input works properly.

### Multi-touch
Gooey supports multi-touch for clickable components as long as the following input binding exists:

* Touch trigger - ```multi-touch``` -> ```multitouch```


## Supported components
Gooey supports the following component types:

* [Button](#gooeybuttonnode_id-action_id-action-fn-refresh_fn) - ```gooey.button()```
* [Checkbox](#gooeycheckboxnode_id-action_id-action-fn-refresh_fn) - ```gooey.checkbox()```
* [Radio button](#gooeyradionode_id-group-action_id-action-fn-refresh_fn) - ```gooey.radio()```
* [Input text](#gooeyinputnode_id-keyboard_type-action_id-action-config-refresh_fn) - ```gooey.input()```
* Lists ([static](#gooeystatic_listlist_id-stencil_id-item_ids-action_id-action-fn-refresh_fn) and [dynamic](#gooeydynamic_listlist_id-root_id-stencil_id-item_id-data-action_id-action-fn-refresh_fn)):
  * ```gooey.static_list()``` All list item nodes are already added to the list. Good for showing a small data set or when the list item nodes should vary in composition and looks.
  * ```gooey.dynamic_list()``` All list item nodes are created from the same template. The nodes are reused when scrolling. Good for showing a large data set.
* [Vertical scrollbar](#gooeyvertical_scrollbarhandle_id-bounds_id-action_id-action-fn-refresh_fn) - ```gooey.scrollbar()```


### gooey.button(node_id, action_id, action, fn, refresh_fn)

**HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL LISTS**

It is possible to configure the list to be handled as either horizontal or vertical list by modifying is_horizontal flag in list.
You can do this either by adding a flag in a dynamic_list() or static_list() call, modyfing the list.is_horizontal flag by yourself or use those convenience functions:

			gui.play_flipbook(input.node, hash("input_selected"))
		elseif input.deselected_now then
			gui.play_flipbook(input.node, hash("input_normal"))
		end
	end

	function on_input(self, action_id, action)
		gooey.input("input/text", gui.KEYBOARD_TYPE_DEFAULT, action_id, action, nil, update_input)
	end

**STATE**

It is possible to set the state of an input node:

    update_input(gooey.input("input/text", gui.KEYBOARD_TYPE_DEFAULT).set_visible(false))
    update_input(gooey.input("input/text", gui.KEYBOARD_TYPE_DEFAULT).set_text("foobar"))

**CONFIG**

It is possible to configure the minimum time required to detect a long-press:

    gooey.input("input/text").set_long_pressed_time(time)


## Consuming input
Each Gooey component has a ```consumed``` variable in its state stable. Consuming input in a gui_script to prevent input propagation can be done by checking the consumed state of each component. If any component has ```consumed``` set to true it is safe to return true from the ```on_input()``` function to prevent input propagation. It is also possible to wrap all component interaction in an input group and check the consumed state for the entire group:

    local gooey = require "gooey.gooey"

    function on_input(self, action_id, action)

## Gooey Themes
Gooey comes shipped with two themes: Dirty Larry and Kenneyblue. You can use these as they are or make a copy and modify. Each theme consists of a Lua module wrapping Gooey, a couple of GUI templates, a font and an atlas containing the visual representation of the components. Use the themes like this:

	local kenneyblue = require "gooey.themes.kenneyblue.kenneyblue"

	function on_input(self, action_id, action)
		kenneyblue.button("button", action_id, action, function(button)
			print("pressed button")
		end)
	end
